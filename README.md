### Welcome!! My name is LEE-hyeon.

I will record all the footsteps of my studies and interests on GitHub.

Until now, I has studied AI mathmatics and basic Machine Learning models and Deep Learning models.

Then plans to study Artificial Intelligence fields in the future. I want to study computer vision and Optimization that can be used in many industrial fields now. Now I'm trying to strengthen the basics by studying various computers science knowleage that are the basis for studying AI.

The projects implemented so far are mainly web front-end based on react.js, but I want to expand additional language and stacks.

Please show a lot of interest my github!!
